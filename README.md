This repository contains all the tasks and projects completed during my React.js internship at Coding Samurai. Throughout this internship, I worked on building dynamic and responsive web applications using core React concepts such as components, props, state management, routing, hooks, and CRUD operations.

Projects include:
✅ Counter Application
✅ To-Do List App (with localStorage, filters, and beautiful UI)
